Nice to meet you! I'm currently a student at Bina Nusantara University, majoring in Game Application and Technology üéÆ. I learned coding from Coding Bee (course), Bina Nusantara game development workshop, and 6-months Google Play X Unity training program. I have been making some games especially for competitions for around 2 years.</br></br>

      <td valign="text-top">‚ÄúBROKEN‚Äù is a psychological horror puzzle-adventure where you play as a child trapped in a warped world fabricated by their fractured mind.

This project is completed in 1 month and for COMPFEST Indie Game Ignite Competition.</td>
