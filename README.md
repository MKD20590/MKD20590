Nice to meet you! I'm currently a student at Bina Nusantara University, majoring in Game Application and Technology üéÆ. I learned coding from Coding Bee (course), Bina Nusantara game development workshop, and 6-month google play x unity training program. I have been making some games especially for competitions for around 2 years.</br>
